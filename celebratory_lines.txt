Go ahead and gloat, you toad.
Winner! Winner! Secret sinner!
Woah! How did you do that?
That's just sheer acuity and perseverance there!
You really won? Damn! The opponent must really be a dum-dum.
Next time, maybe take on someone your own size.
Now, blow a raspberry in the general direction of your opponent.
You won? Awesome!
Do not fret! A place in the hall of fame has now been reserved for you.
Don't panic! Wins sometimes occur.
