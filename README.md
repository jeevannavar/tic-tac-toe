There's many features I'd like to implement as I go along. Some of them are:

1. To improve the user experience:  
    ~~Allow entering player names.~~   
    ~~Have random celebratory lines.~~   
    ~~Colour.~~   
    Fixed game board.  
    GUI with the ability to interact with using the cursor.  
    
2. To allow single-player gameplay:  
    Random move bot.  
    A perfect move bot.  
    
3. Networked gaming:  
    Allow players on different terminals to play over the internet.
