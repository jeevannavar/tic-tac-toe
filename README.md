# TIC TAC TOE

This project is simple tic tac toe game that I've implemented in Python3, because I'm bored and need to do something. For now, it is very simple. Both the players have to be on the same terminal. 

## Requirements

Python3

## Features to be implemented

There's many features I'd like to implement as I go along. Some of them are:

1. To improve the user experience:  
    ~~Allow entering player names.~~   
    ~~Have random celebratory lines.~~   
    Colour.   
        The means to add colour has been added, and some colour has been added too. However, the main functions are untouched.  
    Fixed game board.  
    GUI with the ability to interact with using the cursor.  
    
2. To allow single-player gameplay:  
    Random move bot.  
    A perfect move bot.  
    
3. Networked gaming:  
    Allow players on different terminals to play over the internet.
